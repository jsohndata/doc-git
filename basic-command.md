# Doc: Git - Basic Commands
Git is a powerful version control system used by developers to manage their code.

## Basic Commands
* `git init` - Initializes a new Git repository in the current directory.
* `git add` - Adds changes made to a file to the staging area.
* `git commit` -  Commits the changes in the staging area to the repository along with a commit message describing the changes.
* `git push` - Pushes committed changes to a remote repository, like GitHub.
* `git status` - Shows the status of the current repository, including any changes made to files and their staging status.


## Next Phase
* `git pull` -  Pulls changes from a remote repository into the local repository.
* `git branch` -  Lists all local branches or creates a new branch.
* `git merge` - Merges changes from one branch to another.
* `git log` - Shows a log of all the commits made to the repository.
* `git diff` - Shows the differences between the working directory and the repository.



## For starters
1. `git init`
2. `git status` - File/Directory will be red if not added to staging.
3. `git add .`
4. `git status` - File/Directory will be green once added to staging.
5. `git commit -m "Note"`
6. `git status`
7. `git push -u origin main` - For now write it until memorized.
